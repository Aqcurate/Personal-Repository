Problem:

We encrypted a flag with AES-ECB encryption using a secret key, and got the
hash: 
e220eb994c8fc16388dbd60a969d4953f042fc0bce25dbef573cf522636a1ba3fafa1a7c21ff824a5824c5dc4a376e75 
However, we lost our plaintext flag and also lost our key and we can't seem to
decrypt the hash back :(. 
Luckily we encrypted a bunch of other flags with the same key. Can you recover 
the lost flag using this?

Writeup:

- The ECB cipher is seperated into blocks of 16 bytes.
- One block in our hash corresponds with one block in another hash
- Block E220eb994c8fc16388dbd60a969d4953 is the first block in 
abctf{looks_like_gospel_feebly}
- We can deduce the first 16 letters of abctf{looks_like_gospel_feebly} is in
our flag
- Block F042fc0bce25dbef573cf522636a1ba3 is the second block in
abctf{verism_evg_you_can_break_ajugas}
- Block Fafa1a7c21ff824a5824c5dc4a376e75 is the final block in
abctf{yabbi_palaka_eared_baned_bonito_debell_bares}
- Combine all the sections together and you get the flag
