narnia0
- Let's go to the problem
	- cd /narnia
- We see two programs about narnia0
- Let's look at the c program
	- cat narnia0.c
- It looks like the buffer is 20 bytes long. We can overflow this by inputting more than 20 characters
- Let's input 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB' and see if it changes val
- Indeed it does, now we need to change BBBB to the ascii value of deadbeef
- Since this is little endian, we need to find 0\xef0\xbe0\xad0\xad0\xde in ascii
- I made a simple shell script (in /tmp/deadbeeffun)

	#!/bin/bash

	echo -e 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xef\xbe\xad\xde\xaa'

*This will not work without a character at the end for some reason. No idea why this occurs. Only works with some characters too. 
- Let's input it in the ./narnia0 program
- cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1
